				<p>These are some of the notable research projects I've done, both by myself and as part of a team.</p>

			<h3 class="purple-text title">Tic-Tac-Toe as Linear Algebra</h3>
				<p>Available <a href="research/modelling-essay-1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Written as part of the APS162 (Calculus I for Engineers) course at the University of Toronto in Summer 2017.</p>
				<h4 class="purple-text title">Premise and Summary</h4>
				<p>Tic-tac-toe, largely due to its simplicity, is perhaps one of the most analyzed games in history. Many algorithms have been developed to play the game perfectly (including the well-known minimax algorithm	&ndash; a general 
				algorithm in game theory that minimizes the maximum score of the opponent), and a countless number of software programs have been written to implement these algorithms. Almost always, the program will require iterating 
				through many possible moves, sometimes 3 or more moves ahead, to determine the best choice of move for the current game board. As a result, inefficiencies can plague otherwise ingenious code.</p>
				<p>Linear algebra can help us improve the efficiency of tic-tac-toe programs. In particular, we will see how representing every move with a specific matrix can lend us insight into the best move for every game position.</p>

			<h3 class="purple-text title">Early Detection of Forest Fires</h3>
				<p>Available <a href="research/esp-1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Written as part of the APS111 (Engineering Strategies and Practice I) course at the University of Toronto in Fall 2017.</p>
				<h4 class="purple-text title">Premise and Summary</h4>
				<p>Wildfires in Ontario cause significant damage to the economy, infrastructure, and lives of remote and indigenous communities. This damage is caused solely by the 2.8% of wildfires that escape current early detection 
				methods. As a result, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry needs a design that can detect wildfires in a short timeframe to allow fire services ample time to take action. This document covers the 
				foundations of the project by providing functions, objectives, constraints, and other necessary information which will aid solution generation. Once the project requirements are complete, ideas were generated, resulting in 
				three possible solutions: the use of drones and satellites, watchtower cameras, and wireless sensor networks. After discussing alternative solutions, the drones and satellites design is chosen as the most effective and the 
				implementation of the design is discussed.</p>
				<p>The following step after the proposed documentation is to implement the solution in the forests which will start with quantitative test performing.</p>

			<h3 class="purple-text title">Cooling Computer Components</h3>
				<p>Available <a href="research/modelling-essay-2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<p>Written as part of the APS163 (Calculus II for Engineers) course at the University of Toronto in Fall 2017.</p>
				<h4 class="purple-text title">Premise and Summary</h4>
				<p>This paper will examine the mechanisms behind various methodologies of cooling computer components. Specifically, the basis behind a passive-cooling system, an air-cooling system, and a liquid-cooling system will be 
				explored. The focus will be on the cooling of a central processing unit, or CPU, though other components will likely adhere to the same basic principles that we will discover in our analysis.</p>
				<p>It may be interesting to apply these basic principles to more exotic forms of computer cooling. In particular, phase-change cooling &ndash; in which the processor is cooled by the absorption of heat by a gas compressed 
				into a liquid &ndash; and liquid nitrogen (LN2) cooling &ndash; in which liquid nitrogen is "poured" onto the processor and creates an extremely large temperature gradient &ndash; may be compelling to analyze.</p>
