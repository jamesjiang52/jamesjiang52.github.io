			<p class="quote">We embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in the childhood of our species and in each generation asked anew with undiminished wonder: <em>What are the stars</em>? Exploration is in our nature. We began 
			as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.</p>

			<h3 class="purple-text title">Introduction</h3>
				<p>Welcome!</p>
				<p>To borrow from Seinfeld, this is a website about nothing. I created this site because I wanted to try my hand at front-end web development. Clearly, this project is still in its early stages, and much more content and
				improvement is yet to come.</p>
			<div class="hr"></div>
			<h3 class="purple-text title">About the Author</h3>
				<img src="images/about-the-author.png" id="about-the-author-img">
				<p>First of all, I'll talk a little bit about myself. My name is James, and I was born in Japan, in a suburb of Tokyo. I moved to Burnaby, BC, Canada when I was three, and attended high school there. Now, I'm living in
				Toronto, ON.</p>
				<p>I'm currently in my first year of undergraduate post-secondary study at the University of Toronto. I'm enrolled in the Computer Engineering program, and right now, I'm <em>super</em> interested in machine learning and its 
				applications (which is why I'm also planning to do a minor in Artificial Intelligence in my upper years). My other computer-related interests include, among others, quantum computing and large-scale super computing. I 
				absolutely <em>love</em> programming (Python 3 is my favorite language, by far), though admittedly my personal projects are a bit lacking. In my upper years, I plan to enrol in courses pertaining to both computer hardware 
				and software, in order to expose myself to everything that modern computing has to offer. My dream job, as of now, is at Intel Corporation.</p>
				<p>Aside from that, music is another one of my deep interests. I play the piano, the B&#9837; soprano clarinet, and am currently learning how to play guitar. On piano, I absolutely adore pieces from the Romantic era, 
				especially the works of Chopin. (His nocturnes are, in my opinion, the most brilliant pieces that were ever composed.) On clarinet and guitar, in addition to the classical genre, I also play jazz and contemporary 
				compositions. As for listening, my favorites are classical, of course, though I'll also listen to jazz, as well as soundtracks from my favorite movies and video games (as odd as that may seem).</p>
				<p>This provides a great segway into my third major interest: gaming. For me, gaming is an escape from the real world, analogous to a good novel. One of my favorite games of all time is a single-player open-world role-playing 
				game by Bethesda Game Studios, known as <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, which satiates my desire for exploration. This game is exquisitely crafted, and, no doubt, much of the content on this site will pertain in some way to 
				<i>Skyrim</i>. Even the name of this website was inspired by a particular quest from the game that involves the retrieval of an exceedingly powerful ancient artifact.</p>
			<div class="hr"></div>
			<h3 class="purple-text title">Content</h3>
				<p>In terms of the actual content of this site, as I mentioned in the introduction, there isn't a method to this madness. I'll probably be posting code to some of my side projects, as well as writing blog posts to update my 
				progress on them. I might also post some pictures or photographs of stuff, and maybe even upload a few videos and soundtracks. Who knows?</p>
				<p>However, I'd like to keep this site distinct from a "personal portfolio"-type website. This is just a place where I'll post things that I think are worth posting (and probably a few things that aren't), whether or not 
				they're relevant to my career path or not.</p>
